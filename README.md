# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to assist the company, Pewlett Hackard, in assessing their preparedness (from a staffing perspective) for their inevitable "silver tsunami." This company is facing a large number of employees and managers reaching their retirement eligibility within the next few years and is attempting to forecast the number of employees they will need to hire and develop in order to replace those retiring.

In order to assess their preparedness, we created an analysis determining the number of employees retiring within the next few years, their titles, and the number retiring with each title. We also wanted to analyze if the company currently has the correct number of senior-level staff in place to train and develop younger/newer employees to fill the shoes of those retiring.

### Results
* The company can expect to lose 72,458 employees to retirement over the next few years. This can be seen in the Unique Titles spreadsheet [here.](Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis_Challenge/Data/unique_titles.csv)
* Of these retiring employees, the majority of them are in senior level positions. The breakdown by their current title is shown below:

* The company is losing a large number of employees and the number of employees in the qualifying age-range to serve as mentors to younger employees is small - 1,549 employees meet the criteria to serve as mentors.
* The breakdown of titles for employees who would be able to serve as mentors is shown below:
